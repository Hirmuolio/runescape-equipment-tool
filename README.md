# runescape-equipment-tool

Tool for simulating armor and weapon effectiveness against monsters.

The tool can currently handle only melee weapons.

Known inaccurate data:
* Monsters with multiple attack types only use the first one listed.
* Magic based melee/range is not handled.
* Melee accuracy equations are untested (not practical to test).
* Player magic defence equation is based on quessing.
* Using more than one item with damage/accuracy multiplier may be wrong with some items (needs testing).
* Darklight damage bonus is unknown.
* Snelm damage reduction is unknown.
* Probably various bugs.
* Loading bad setups will give bad results.
* You can do nonsense setups.

Monster/item data was sourced from https://www.osrsbox.com/projects/osrsbox-db/ (seems to be dead now). Data is not included in the source. Extract from release if you need it.
